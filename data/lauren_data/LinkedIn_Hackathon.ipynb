Art is a means of communicating the stories, ideas, and values that are central to my studio practice and make this practice accessible and approachable to others. I curate group art shows, host and coordinate events, and lead workshops and demonstrations. Events can be anything from live screen printing to pillow fort building. They can be for fundraising or entertainment or professional experience or all of the above. Through these events, my personal studio practice becomes a platform for engaging and collaborating with others. It's also a great excuse to host potlucks that bring together the best minds over the best food. Is it professionally improper to insert a smiley face on my LinkedIn profile? :)\n",

Using an mRNA reprogramming technique paired with single cell isolation and microfluidic gene expression assays, I have characterized the X chromosome status following reprogramming in human cells. I am currently developing a method to track the X chromosomes throughout the reprogramming process to determine if different subpopulations, with regards to the X chromosome, exist during this process. \n",
